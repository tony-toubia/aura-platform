# Aura Limit Enforcement Solution - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
When users downgrade their subscription (e.g., from Family to Personal), they may have more active auras than their new plan allows. This solution automatically handles these scenarios while providing a smooth user experience.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Automatic Enforcement (Webhook Flow)
1. User downgrades subscription in Stripe
2. Stripe webhook fires â†’ `SubscriptionService.handleWebhook()`
3. System detects downgrade by comparing tier hierarchy
4. `AuraLimitService.enforceAuraLimits()` automatically disables excess auras
5. Oldest, least complex auras are disabled first
6. User sees notification on next platform visit

### User Management Flow
1. User sees clear notification about limit violation
2. "Manage Auras" interface shows active/disabled auras with priority scores
3. Smart suggestions help users choose which auras to keep
4. One-click enable/disable with real-time limit validation
5. Clear upgrade prompts provide path to restore full access

## ðŸ“Š Subscription Limits Enforced

| Tier | Max Active Auras | Auto-Enforcement |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Free (Starter) | 1 | âœ… Yes |
| Personal | 3 | âœ… Yes |
| Family | 10 | âœ… Yes |
| Business | Unlimited | âœ… No limits |

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Smart Priority Algorithm**: Disables least important auras first
- **Graceful User Experience**: Clear notifications and management tools
- **Automatic Enforcement**: No manual intervention required
- **Upgrade Incentives**: Clear paths to restore functionality
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of enforcement actions
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## ðŸ”’ Security & Reliability

- User isolation (users can only manage their own auras)
- Subscription validation (all limits validated against current subscription)
- Graceful error handling (system continues working even if components fail)
- Input validation (all user inputs properly validated)

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
node scripts/test-aura-limits.js
```

The test creates a user, sets up multiple auras, simulates a subscription downgrade, and verifies that excess auras are properly disabled.

## ðŸ“ˆ Production Readiness

This solution is production-ready and includes:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimizations
- User-friendly interfaces
- Complete audit logging
- Extensive documentation
- Integration testing

The system provides a seamless experience for handling subscription downgrades while maintaining data integrity and encouraging upgrades through clear value demonstration.
